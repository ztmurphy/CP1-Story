I woke up
I got changed
I fed my Fish
I brushed my teeth
I ate some food
I went to School
I took my Algebra Exit Exam
I sat in a gym balcony
I ate lunch
I sat through a boring seventh period
I slept through Academy
I took the bus home
I did homework
I walked Finley
I did more homework
I ate dinner
I fed my fish
I went to sleep
